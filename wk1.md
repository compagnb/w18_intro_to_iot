## Week 1: Introduction

### Internet Of Things (IoT)
* “the interconnection via the Internet of computing devices embedded in everyday objects, enabling them to send and receive data” - dictionary.com
* It is taking a “less intelligent” item, and make it “Smarter” by controlling it through HTTP (Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol)  Requests through the web server.
* Some examples of some IoT projects could be:
    * Home Automations
    * Ski Condition Alert
    * Robotics
    * Environmental Sensing
    * Health Monitoring

### Web Basics Review
* A browser is an application running on your computer (or smartphone, tablet, etc.) that makes it possible for us to see a webpage. Examples of browsers are: Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, etc
* Web Servers are computers that are always connected to the internet, and send data out when requested. 
* If you enter a URL (web address) into the browser, this information is divided up into smaller pieces
    * Protocol - (How?) It tells the computer how to talk to the server.
    * Server - (Where?) It tells the computer the name of the web server.
    * Path - (What?) It tells the computer what you are requesting to view.

    * The Browser connects to the DNS server.
    * The DNS server then tells the browser the location of the web server hosting the site.
    * The IP Address that the DNS server returns to your computer allows your browser to contact the web server that hosts the website you requested.
    * The web server then sends the page you requested back to your web browser.
* Internet Service Provider (ISP) is a company that provides access to the internet. (i.e. Verizon, optimum, aol)
* Domain Name System (DNS) Server translates domain names and hostnames into an IP address. This works like a big phone book! 
* Internet Protocol Address (IP Address) is a unique string of numbers separated by periods thatidentify each computer connected using an Internet Protocol to communicate over a network. (i.e. 127.0.0.0)
* The browser sends a message to the web server called an HTTP Request. It answers the browser with an HTTP Respond.

    * If the server cannot find what the browser requested, the HTTP Response is a 404 error. 
    * HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. It was designed to download so-called hypertext documents (web pages) and to send some basic information back to the web server.
    * Web pages are created using the formatting language HTML, or HyperText Markup Language.

### All About Communication
Web development is all about the communication between 2 parties:
The client, which requests pages from the server, and displays them to the user. This is usually coded in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The server, which is responsible for serving pages. This is usually programmed in Python, Rails, Java, SQL, JavaScript, etc.
In most cases, the client is a web browser, but this could also be another device that is connected to the internet.
Client Side Programming - make interactive web pages, as well as, making stuff happen dynamically on a web page and can interact with temporary storage, and local storage (cookies, localStorage) 
Server Side Programming - processes user input, displays pages, structures web applications, and interacts, with permanent storage (database & files).
